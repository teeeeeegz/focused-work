# Privacy Policy
## Debugging Data
We use Bugsnag for crash reporting. These reports include non-identifiable information such as when the crash occurred, and the version of iOS. We will not see any of the data you've entered. Bugsnag's privacy policy can be found [here](https://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous data, only for use in improving the app. The privacy policy for Firebase can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics).

## Personal Data
**We collect no personal data at all. Nothing.** Everything do you is saved on-device and to your iCloud, which is synced across your devices using the same iCloud account.

## Any Questions?
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:focusedworkapp@michaeltigas.com.au).
