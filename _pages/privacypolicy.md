# Privacy Policy
## Debugging Data
We use Sentry for crash reporting. These reports include non-identifiable information such as when the crash occurred, and the version of iOS. We will not see any of the data you've entered. Sentry's privacy policy can be found [here](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

We use Amplitude to collect anonymous data, only for use in improving the app. The privacy policy for Amplitude can be found [here](https://amplitude.com/privacy/).

## Personal Data
**We collect no personal data at all. Nothing.** Everything you do is saved on-device and to your iCloud, which is synced across your devices using the same iCloud account.

## Any Questions?
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:focusedworkapp@michaeltigas.com.au).
