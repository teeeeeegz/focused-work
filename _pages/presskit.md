# What is Focused Work?

**Focused Work is a simple, flexible Focus Timer that helps you structure your time effectively.**

Structure keeps you fresh and productive, so you can get more work done!

A key strength of Focused Work is creating timed focus sessions that break up tasks into smaller parts.

> Each task, such as studying, coding, and content writing, could be structured as; a 5-minute
 Planning stage, two 45-minute Focused Work stages, with a 10-minute Break stage in the middle

Every session helps you remain self-accountable by asking what will you focus on, and reminds you to maintain your focus.

## About the Developer

Hey, I'm Michael! ðŸ‘‹

I've createdÂ funÂ iOS and Android apps for the last six years, as a freelancer & consultant under my brand [Hey, I Make Apps!](https://heyimakeapps.com), living in Melbourne, Australia.

Focused Work began as something to replace a Pomodoro chatbot a few mates and I were using every day. 

Before starting a session we entered commands to trigger alerts for when to work or take a break, but it eventually became repetitive and annoying. Although, we did enjoy the ability to experiment with adjusting when to show them, and its message.

We decided to either create a smarter bot, or I could leverage my knowledge of mobile apps to create a better utility for our phones. The former sounded much less fun, so I began searching the App Store.

Most focused work apps were Pomodoro-centric and not really customisable. We also needed to adjust the timer when swapping between tasks that were well-defined or open-ended, as some required more time to reach a flow state. 

None had reminders to snap us out of scrolling our Facebook or Twitter feeds when we should be working!

I was convinced I could scratch the itch by creating my own app that addressed the above, so we could;

1. Reach a flow-state regardless of the type of task
2. Prevent ourselves from overworking
3. Be reminded to keep focusing, and take appropriate breaks

I began with a blank canvas in March 2020, and after more than 540 focused work hours across 186 days, I am super excited to share the app!

I hope it encourages people to get more productive work done every day, as it has for me. ðŸ™‚
