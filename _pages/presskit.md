# What is Focused Work?

**Focused Work is a simple app that helps you focus on tasks, and adds structure to your time so you can get more stuff done every day.**

Sitting down and starting a timer has good intent, but without boundaries, it's hard to decide how productive you want to be for the day, or prevent mental burnout.

One of its primary strengths is creating timed Focus Session's, which adds structure to your time so you can consistently focus on your tasks.

Sessions are structured with Focused Work, Planning, and Break stages, where you can design and optimise the perfect work routine to help reach a deep-focus state.

> For example, you can create a session for coding or content writing tasks, by structuring it with a 5-minute Planning stage, two 45-minute Focused Work stages, and a 10-minute Break in the middle to keep your mind fresh.

## Core Features

- **Create Focus Sessions for common tasks** Structure your time into Focused Work, Planning, and Break stages, for each task.
- **Declare your focus before each session** You'll always see what your goal is, so you don't lose your way.
- **Minimal UI** Only see what's important mid-session. The timer, your focus, and the current stage.
- **"Stay Focused" alerts** Be reminded to stay on track mid-session, and when to take a break.
- **Squeeze in a quick session** See what time each session will finish, at a glance.
- **Adjustable Daily Goals** Build momentum by completing focused work every day, and start a streak.
- **Productivity Tracking** Rate your productivity, and add short notes to reflect on your habits.
- **Toggl Integration** Track time once, by assigning a project to send focus time to Toggl.
- **iCloud Syncing** Switch between devices based on the task. All sessions and goals are automatically synced to iOS devices logged in with the same Apple ID.
- **Dark Mode** Perfect for night owls, that prefer to not have the timer light up the room at night.

## About the Developer

Hey, I'm Michael! ðŸ‘‹

I've been creating and launchingÂ fun & effectiveÂ iOS and Android mobile apps for the last six years, as a freelancer & consultant under my brand [Hey, I Make Apps!](https://heyimakeapps.com), based in Melbourne, Australia.

Focused Work started back in March 2020, as something to replace a Pomodoro chatbot on Discord that me and a few mates were using every day, whilst working from home. Over time we found it didn't scale well, as sessions felt too short to get into a flow-state for coding & content writing tasks, but were great for the average daily checklist.

I searched the App Store for a simple and flexible alternative, to avoid diving into the settings each time I wanted to move between different task types, but most focus apps felt Pomodoro-centric.

I figured I'd scratch my own itch and create a utility that'd let me create focus sessions catered to a type of task to;

1. Help me reach a flow-state
2. Prevent me from overworking
3. Be reminded to focus, during the session

After working my butt off across 160+ days and 410+ focused work hours, the app has grown into what it is today and I'm super excited to share it.

I hope it encourages people to get more productive work done, every day, as it has for me. ðŸ™‚
