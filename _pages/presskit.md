# What is Focused Work?

**Focused Work is an app that helps you focus and structure your time.**

Structure helps you get work done. It allows you to focus and take breaks, to stay fresh and productive all day.

A key strength of the app is creating timed focus sessions, to break tasks up into focused work and break periods. Finding the right balance for reaching a state of deep focus, is key.

> For example, you can create a session for study, coding, or content writing tasks, with a structure of; a 5-minute planning stage, two 45-minute focused work stages, and a 10-minute break stage in the middle. The app will remind you to focus mid-session, and take a break to keep your mind fresh.

## Core Features

- **Create timed Focus Sessions** Add structure to your tasks with focused work, planning, and break stages.
- **Define your focus** Knowing your goal helps you make better decisions to complete a task.
- **Simple design** Always-on timer. See your focus and current stage at a glance. Rotate the screen. 
- **Distraction alerts** Be reminded to stay focused, and when to take a break.
- **Estimated finish times** See what time a session will finish at a glance, to squeeze in a quick task.
- **Productivity Goals** Build momentum and a streak, by completing focused work every day.
- **Productivity Reflection** Rate sessions, and add short notes to highlight good or bad habits.
- **Toggl Integration** Track time once, by assigning a project to your focus session.
- **iCloud Syncing** Switch between devices based on the task. All sessions and goals are automatically synced to iOS devices logged in with the same Apple ID.
- **Dark Mode** Perfect for productive night owls, so the timer doesn't light up your room.

## About the Developer

Hey, I'm Michael! ðŸ‘‹

I've createdÂ funÂ iOS and Android apps for the last six years, as a freelancer & consultant under my brand [Hey, I Make Apps!](https://heyimakeapps.com), living in Melbourne, Australia.

Focused Work began as something to replace a Pomodoro chatbot a few mates and I were using every day. 

Before starting a session we entered commands to trigger alerts for when to work or take a break, but it eventually became repetitive and annoying. Although, we did enjoy the ability to experiment with adjusting when to show them, and its message.

We decided to either create a smarter bot, or I could leverage my knowledge of mobile apps to create a better utility for our phones. The former sounded much less fun, so I began searching the App Store.

Most focused work apps were Pomodoro-centric and not really customisable. We also needed to adjust the timer when swapping between tasks that were well-defined or open-ended, as some required more time to reach a flow state. 

None had reminders to snap us out of scrolling our Facebook or Twitter feeds when we should be working!

I was convinced I could scratch the itch by creating my own app that addressed the above, so we could;

1. Reach a flow-state regardless of the type of task
2. Prevent ourselves from overworking
3. Be reminded to keep focusing, and take appropriate breaks

I began with a blank canvas in March 2020, and after more than 430 focused work hours across 165 days, I am super excited to share the app!

I hope it encourages people to get more productive work done every day, as it has for me. ðŸ™‚
