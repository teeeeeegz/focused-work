# What is Focused Work?

**Focused Work is a simple app that helps you focus, time-box your tasks, and create a sustainable productivity habit.**

Work or study, any task has a different approach to reach a deep-focus state. But focusing for too long can lead to feeling mentally drained.

One of its primary strengths is the ability to assign a timed Focus Session to a task, and divide it into focused work, planning, and break stages, to maintain focus and efficiency during the task, and throughout your day.

The app will guide and remind you to focus during each session, and give a clear understanding of the time commitment to complete a session, so you can plan your daily tasks & schedule in advance.

> For example, it's 2:06 pm and you need to urgently complete a daily task, but have a meeting at 3 pm, you might decide to pick a Focus Session that's 45 minutes long. Before starting, you'll see the estimated finish time (2:51 pm) and confidently know you'll have enough time to reach a deep-focus state, make your meeting on-time, and not be disrupted by time-pressure.

## Core Features

- **iCloud Syncing** Switch between devices based on the task. All sessions and goals are automatically synced to your iOS devices.
- **Dark Mode.** Perfect for night owls that prefer to not have the timer light up the room at night.

## About the Developer

Hey, I'm Michael! ðŸ‘‹

I've been creating and launchingÂ fun & effectiveÂ iOS and Android mobile apps for the last six years, as a freelancer & consultant under my brand [Hey, I Make Apps!](https://heyimakeapps.com), based in Melbourne, Australia.

Focused Work started back in March 2020, as something to replace a Pomodoro chatbot on Discord that me and a few mates were using every day, whilst working from home. Over time we found it didn't scale well, as sessions felt too short to get into a flow-state for coding & content writing tasks, but were great for the average daily checklist.

I searched the App Store for a simple and flexible alternative, to avoid diving into the settings each time I wanted to move between different task types, but most focus apps felt Pomodoro-centric.

I figured I'd scratch my own itch and create a utility that'd let me create focus sessions catered to a type of task to;

1. Help me reach a flow-state
2. Prevent me from overworking
3. Be reminded to focus, during the session

After working my butt off 160+ days later since the pandemic first hit Australia, the app has grown into what it is today, and I'm super excited to share it.

I hope it encourages people to get more productive work done, every day, as it has for me. ðŸ™‚
