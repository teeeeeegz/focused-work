# What is Focused Work?

**Focused Work is an app which helps you focus and structure your time, to get tasks done.**

It's a pocket productivity-buddy, that lets you design the perfect work routine for reaching a deep-focus state. By following simple ground rules as you work, your mind stays fresh and productive across the day.

One of its primary strengths is the ability to create a structured Focus Session for a task. You can add Focused Work, Planning, and Break stages, and adjust their time and order depending on the type of task.

> For example, you can create a session for coding or content writing tasks, with a structure of; a 5-minute Planning stage, two 45-minute Focused Work stages, and a 10-minute Break stage in the middle. Depending on the current stage, the app will remind you to focus mid-session or take a break to keep your mind fresh.

## Core Features


- **Create Focus Sessions** Structure your common tasks into timed Focused Work, Planning, and Break stages.
- **Define your focus** By acknowledging your goal, you'll consciously make better decisions to complete your task.
- **Clean UI** Use the app as a standard timer, with only your focus and current stage displayed mid-session.
- **"Stay Focused" alerts** Be reminded to stay on track and when to take a break.
- **Estimated finish times** See what time a session will finish at a glance, to squeeze in a quick task.
- **Adjustable Daily Goals** Build momentum and a streak, by completing focused work every day.
- **Productivity Tracking** Reflect on your productivity and add short notes to highlight good and bad habits.
- **Toggl Integration** Track time once by assigning a project to a Focus Session, and share Focused Work time.
- **iCloud Syncing** Switch between devices based on the task. All sessions and goals are automatically synced to iOS devices logged in with the same Apple ID.
- **Dark Mode** Perfect for productive night owls, so the timer doesn't light up your room.

## About the Developer

Hey, I'm Michael! ðŸ‘‹

I've been creating and launchingÂ fun & effectiveÂ iOS and Android mobile apps for the last six years, as a freelancer & consultant under my brand [Hey, I Make Apps!](https://heyimakeapps.com), based in Melbourne, Australia.

Focused Work started back in March 2020, as something to replace a Pomodoro chatbot on Discord that me and a few mates were using every day, whilst working from home. Over time we found it didn't scale well, as sessions felt too short to get into a flow-state for coding & content writing tasks, but were great for the average daily checklist.

I searched the App Store for a simple and flexible alternative, to avoid diving into the settings each time I wanted to move between different task types, but most focus apps felt Pomodoro-centric.

I figured I'd scratch my own itch and create a utility that'd let me create focus sessions catered to a type of task to;

1. Help me reach a flow-state
2. Prevent me from overworking
3. Be reminded to focus, during the session

After working my butt off across 160+ days and 410+ focused work hours, the app has grown into what it is today and I'm super excited to share it.

I hope it encourages people to get more productive work done, every day, as it has for me. ðŸ™‚
